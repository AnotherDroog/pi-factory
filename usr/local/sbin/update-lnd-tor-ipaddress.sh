# This script is a helper script that rewrites the host IP to the new IP Address (used for TOR only nodes).
# if the node LAN IP changes (or box is plugged into a new LAN), lnd is unable to obviously connect to the new TOR IP address.
# Basically this is an edge case right now as the merchant box should always have the same LAN IP.
